# Amazon Viewer

Amazon Viewer is a personal project to learn basic Java and more advanced things.
(Not to be serious I just wanted to put all my java knowledge in a repo).

## Installation

Clone the project in your IDE for the basic version, the advanced version has other measures see it in its respective branch and README.

## Usage

The use is simple is a emulation of all amazon services you can see movies, series, read books and more. just run main and the rest is very intuitive.

## What it use

A lot of java stuff is used at a basic level from imports my own library, classes, nested classes and interfaces. To save the data of the movies it is inside arrays so that the variables of the seen change when closing the program. This was solved in the advanced version with a database.
